# Antigravity Agentic SDLC Plugin

This plugin provides a comprehensive suite of skills and commands for Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) workflows (pull requests, code reviews, releases) within Google Antigravity. It is a cross-platform port (POSIX and Windows) of the Antigravity Code SDLC plugin built on the basis of https://rnagrodzki.github.io/sdlc-marketplace/.

## Quick Start

Once installed, the SDLC skills are automatically registered with your Antigravity agent. You can invoke them via the chat interface:

- `/commit-sdlc` - Commit staged changes
- `/pr-sdlc` - Create a pull request
- `/review-sdlc` - Review changes
- `/ship-sdlc` - Ship a release

### 🚀 See It In Action

Writing code and managing your release lifecycle has never been simpler. With the SDLC plugin, you can go from an issue to a Pull Request by calling dedicated skills directly:

> **You:** `/github-sdlc view issue #42`
> 
> **Antigravity:** *(Reads issue #42 "Implement OAuth2 login flow" using the GitHub CLI)*<br>
> I've retrieved the issue details. Let's start with a plan.
> 
> **You:** `/plan-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Generates architecture plan and saves it to `implementation_plan.md`)*<br>
> Here is the implementation plan for OAuth2. Does this look good?
>
> **You:** Looks perfect, go ahead. `/execute-plan-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Executes the plan, runs tests, and stages the files)*<br>
> OAuth2 flow implemented successfully!
>
> **You:** `/commit-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Analyzes staged files and commits)*<br>
> 📝 **Auto-generated Commit:** `feat(auth): implement OAuth2 login flow (#42)`
>
> **You:** `/pr-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Runs GitHub PR flow)*<br>
> 🚀 **Pull Request created!** The PR description has been automatically populated with the business context and linked to Issue #42.

## Installation

You can install this plugin either globally for all workspaces, or locally for a specific workspace.

### Global Installation (Recommended)

To make the plugin available in all your Antigravity workspaces, clone this repository into your global Antigravity plugins directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dnichyparuk/antigravity-sdlc.git ~/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc
```

### Workspace Installation

To install the plugin only for a specific workspace, navigate to the root of your project and clone it into the local `.agents` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/plugins
git clone https://github.com/dnichyparuk/antigravity-sdlc.git .agents/plugins/sdlc
```

## Configuration

### Permissions

To prevent Antigravity from repeatedly asking for permission to run the plugin's internal helper scripts (e.g. for planning, validation, and telemetry), you should explicitly whitelist the plugin's execution folders.

Open your global Antigravity settings file (typically located at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`) and add the following agnostic rules to the `permissions.allow` array:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "command(node .*/\\.gemini/config/plugins/.*)",
      "command(.*/\\.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc/skills/.*/scripts/.*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

These rules use standard regex to automatically trust any Node script or embedded bash script inside the plugin, regardless of your OS, username, or installation path.

### Plans Directory

By default, when you run `/plan-sdlc` in Normal Mode (not in an active plan session), the plugin writes your generated implementation plans to your home directory under `~/.gemini/plans/`. Since this path is outside your project workspace, it will trigger a permission prompt in the Antigravity sandbox.

You can configure a custom location for your plans either globally or locally for a specific repository using the `plansDirectory` setting in `settings.json`.

#### Global Configuration
To save plans to a custom directory for all projects, edit `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "plansDirectory": "/absolute/path/to/your/global/plans"
}
```

#### Project-Specific Configuration
To save plans to a folder within a specific project (such as inside the `.sdlc` folder), create or edit `<project-root>/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`. Relative paths configured here resolve from the project root:
```json
{
  "plansDirectory": ".sdlc/plans"
}
```
The plugin automatically creates the directory structure if it does not already exist.

## SDLC Pipeline Structure

This plugin implements a complete, end-to-end Software Development Lifecycle process natively within the chat interface. The workflow is structured into the following distinct phases:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Issue["Issue Tracking<br/>/github-sdlc, /jira-sdlc"]
    Plan["Planning & Execution<br/>/plan-sdlc, /execute-plan-sdlc"]
    Commit["Committing<br/>/commit-sdlc"]
    Review["Code Review<br/>/review-sdlc"]
    PR["Pull Requests<br/>/pr-sdlc"]
    CI["Continuous Integration<br/>/verify-pipeline-sdlc"]
    CI_Check{"CI Passed?"}
    Recover["Hardening & Recovery<br/>/error-report-sdlc, /harden-sdlc"]
    Ship["Shipping & Release<br/>/version-sdlc, /ship-sdlc"]

    Issue -. "Scopes work" .-> Plan
    Plan --> Commit
    Commit --> Review
    Review --> PR
    PR --> CI
    CI --> CI_Check
    CI_Check -- "No" --> Recover
    Recover -. "Fix Issue" .-> Plan
    CI_Check -- "Yes" --> Ship
    Ship -. "Resolves" .-> Issue
```

1. **Planning & Execution** (`/plan-sdlc`, `/execute-plan-sdlc`)
   - Scopes requirements, proposes architectural decisions, and breaks down the work into manageable tasks.
   - Executes the implementation plan systematically while adhering to guardrails.
2. **Committing** (`/commit-sdlc`)
   - Automatically generates smart, conventional commit messages by analyzing your staged diff and recent project history.
3. **Code Review** (`/review-sdlc`)
   - Performs a comprehensive, automated code review of your changes against predefined dimensions (e.g., security, architecture, performance) before you open a Pull Request.
4. **Pull Requests** (`/pr-sdlc`)
   - Generates detailed, well-structured PR descriptions based on the diff and commit history.
5. **Continuous Integration** (`/verify-pipeline-sdlc`)
   - Interfaces with GitHub Actions to monitor, verify, and diagnose CI/CD pipeline runs for your PRs.
6. **Hardening & Recovery** (`/error-report-sdlc`, `/harden-sdlc`)
   - If a pipeline fails or an error occurs, these skills analyze the failure to suggest stronger guardrails, preventing the same class of failure in the future.
7. **Shipping & Release** (`/version-sdlc`, `/ship-sdlc`)
   - Automates semantic versioning, changelog generation, and finalizing the release of the project.

## Agents Reference

Skills delegate isolated, context-clean subtasks to specialized agents. There are two categories:

### Registered Plugin Agents

These agents are defined in `agents/*.md` and dispatched via `sdlc:<name>`. They inherit no conversation context — all inputs arrive through a prepared manifest file.

| Agent | Dispatched by | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan-explore-orchestrator` | `/plan-sdlc` | flash-low | Derives 3–7 task-specific discovery dimensions and fans out parallel code/web/hybrid sub-agents to produce `discovery-brief.md`. |
| `plan-generation-orchestrator` | `/plan-sdlc` | pro-high | Receives the exploration brief and writes the structured `implementation_plan.md` file. |
| `plan-execution-validator` | `/execute-plan-sdlc` | pro-low | Validates plan integrity (circular deps, vague deliverables) and wave structure (file conflicts, risk clustering). Called twice per execution run. |
| `commit-orchestrator` | `/commit-sdlc` | flash-low | Reads the staged diff and commit history from a prepared manifest and returns a single, self-critiqued commit message string. |
| `review-orchestrator` | `/review-sdlc` | flash-low | Reads the review manifest, dispatches dimension sub-agents in parallel, deduplicates and critiques findings, and persists `review-comment.md`. |
| `harden-orchestrator` | `/harden-sdlc` | flash-low | Classifies a pipeline failure as `user-code`, `plugin-defect`, or `ambiguous`, then emits strengthen-only hardening proposals as JSON. |
| `error-report-orchestrator` | `/error-report-sdlc` | flash-low | Fills the `ToolingError.md` issue template from a prepared manifest and returns `{title, body}` JSON for posting to the plugin tracker. |

### Ad-hoc Agents (prompt-template driven)

These agents have no file in `agents/` and are dispatched as `general-purpose` using inline prompt templates. They are implementation details of their parent agents.

| Agent | Parent | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **wave-runner** | `execute-plan-sdlc` (Step 5b) | flash-low (locked) | Executes one wave: fans out per-task coding agents in parallel, handles per-task retries with model escalation, and emits a bounded `WAVE_SUMMARY` token. |
| **per-task coding agent** | wave-runner | Single trivial: flash-medium · Batch of 2+ trivials: flash-low · Standard: flash-high · Complex: pro-low *(balanced tier)* | Implements a single plan task: reads its fact sheet, writes files, runs verification, and returns a structured completion token. |
| **dimension sub-agent** | `review-orchestrator` | Per-dimension override, default: flash-medium | Reviews the diff for one code review dimension and returns a structured findings list. |
| **discovery sub-agent** | `plan-explore-orchestrator` | flash-low / flash-medium / pro-low (per dimension) | Explores code or web sources for one planning dimension and returns `F-<DIM>-<n>` tagged findings. |

> **Model escalation (coding agents):** On failure, the wave-runner escalates the task's model one tier per retry, up to 2 retries: `flash-medium → flash-high → pro-low`, `flash-high → pro-low → pro-high`, `pro-low → pro-high → pro-high + context`.

## Quality Modes (`/execute-plan-sdlc`)

When executing a plan, `/execute-plan-sdlc` asks you to select a **quality tier** that controls which model each coding agent runs on. The tier balances speed and cost against correctness.

> **Note on flag names:** The CLI flag values are counter-intuitively named. `--quality minimal` selects the *Speed* preset (cheapest), while `--quality full` selects the *Quality* preset (most capable).

### Tier Overview

Each task is classified as **Trivial**, **Standard**, or **Complex** based on scope. The tier maps that classification to a model:

| Flag | Display name | Use case | Trivial | Standard | Complex |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--quality minimal` | **Speed** | Fast iteration, drafts, low-stakes changes | flash-low | flash-medium | flash-high |
| `--quality balanced` | **Balanced** *(default)* | Everyday feature work — best cost/quality trade-off | flash-medium | flash-high | pro-low |
| `--quality full` | **Quality** | Architectural changes, high-risk tasks, production releases | flash-medium | pro-low | pro-high |

> **Trivial batching:** when 2 or more Trivial tasks land in the same wave they are batched into a single flash-low agent dispatch. A lone Trivial task runs as an individual agent at the tier's Trivial model.

**Fixed-model agents (not affected by tier selection):**

| Agent | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| wave-runner | flash-low | Permanently locked — performs routing only |
| spec compliance reviewer | flash-high | **Skipped on Speed tier** and on trivial-only waves |
| plan-execution-validator | pro-low | Always pro-low |

### Feature Differences by Tier

| Feature | Speed (`--quality minimal`) | Balanced | Quality (`--quality full`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-wave spec compliance review | ❌ Skipped | ✅ After each non-trivial wave | ✅ After each non-trivial wave |
| Final cross-wave spec review | ❌ Skipped | ✅ When >3 waves or a per-wave issue found | ✅ When >3 waves or a per-wave issue found |
| Tier selection prompt | ✅ Shown (unless `--quality` passed) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom per-task model override | ✅ (`custom` option) | ✅ | ✅ |

### Retry Escalation Ladder

When a coding agent fails, the wave-runner escalates one model tier per retry (max 2 retries per task). Failure context is always added to the retry prompt.

| Starting model | Retry 1 | Retry 2 | After Retry 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| flash-low | flash-medium | pro-low | FAILED → user |
| flash-medium | flash-high | pro-low | FAILED → user |
| flash-high | pro-low | pro-high | FAILED → user |
| pro-low | pro-high | pro-high + failure context | FAILED → user |
| pro-high | pro-high + failure context | — | FAILED → user |

> **Partial batch failure:** if a batch of Trivial tasks partially fails, only the failed tasks are re-dispatched individually with escalation. Completed tasks in the batch are final.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Fastest — skip quality prompt and use Speed preset
/execute-plan-sdlc --quality minimal

# Default — Balanced (can also omit --quality and select interactively)
/execute-plan-sdlc --quality balanced

# Maximum correctness for architectural or high-risk work
/execute-plan-sdlc --quality full

# ship-sdlc forwards --quality when explicitly passed
/ship-sdlc --quality full
```

> **Custom override:** selecting `custom` at the interactive prompt lets you override the model for individual tasks before execution begins. Legacy aliases `A` (minimal/Speed), `B` (balanced), `C` (full/Quality) are accepted and normalised automatically.
