# Antigravity Agentic SDLC Plugin

This plugin provides a comprehensive suite of skills and commands for Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) workflows (pull requests, code reviews, releases) within Google Antigravity. It is a cross-platform port (POSIX and Windows) of the Claude Code SDLC plugin built on the basis of https://rnagrodzki.github.io/sdlc-marketplace/.

## Installation

You can install this plugin either globally for all workspaces, or locally for a specific workspace.

### Global Installation (Recommended)

To make the plugin available in all your Antigravity workspaces, clone this repository into your global Antigravity plugins directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dnichyparuk/antigravity-sdlc.git ~/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc
```

### Workspace Installation

To install the plugin only for a specific workspace, navigate to the root of your project and clone it into the local `.agents` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/plugins
git clone https://github.com/dnichyparuk/antigravity-sdlc.git .agents/plugins/sdlc
```

## Usage

Once installed, the SDLC skills will be automatically registered with your Antigravity agent. You can invoke them via the chat interface, for example:

- `/commit-sdlc` - Commit staged changes
- `/pr-sdlc` - Create a pull request
- `/review-sdlc` - Review changes
- `/ship-sdlc` - Ship a release

## 🚀 See It In Action

Writing code and managing your release lifecycle has never been simpler. With the SDLC plugin, you can go from an issue to a Pull Request by calling dedicated skills directly:

> **You:** `/github-sdlc view issue #42`
> 
> **Antigravity:** *(Reads issue #42 "Implement OAuth2 login flow" using the GitHub CLI)*<br>
> I've retrieved the issue details. Let's start with a plan.
> 
> **You:** `/plan-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Generates architecture plan and saves it to `implementation_plan.md`)*<br>
> Here is the implementation plan for OAuth2. Does this look good?
>
> **You:** Looks perfect, go ahead. `/execute-plan-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Executes the plan, runs tests, and stages the files)*<br>
> OAuth2 flow implemented successfully!
>
> **You:** `/commit-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Analyzes staged files and commits)*<br>
> 📝 **Auto-generated Commit:** `feat(auth): implement OAuth2 login flow (#42)`
>
> **You:** `/pr-sdlc`
>
> **Antigravity:** *(Runs GitHub PR flow)*<br>
> 🚀 **Pull Request created!** The PR description has been automatically populated with the business context and linked to Issue #42.

## SDLC Pipeline Structure

This plugin implements a complete, end-to-end Software Development Lifecycle process natively within the chat interface. The workflow is structured into the following distinct phases:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Issue["Issue Tracking\n(/github-sdlc, /jira-sdlc)"]
    Plan["Planning & Execution\n(/plan-sdlc, /execute-plan-sdlc)"]
    Commit["Committing\n(/commit-sdlc)"]
    Review["Code Review\n(/review-sdlc)"]
    PR["Pull Requests\n(/pr-sdlc)"]
    CI["Continuous Integration\n(/verify-pipeline-sdlc)"]
    CI_Check{"CI Passed?"}
    Recover["Hardening & Recovery\n(/error-report-sdlc, /harden-sdlc)"]
    Ship["Shipping & Release\n(/version-sdlc, /ship-sdlc)"]

    Issue -. "Scopes work" .-> Plan
    Plan --> Commit
    Commit --> Review
    Review --> PR
    PR --> CI
    CI --> CI_Check
    CI_Check -- "No" --> Recover
    Recover -. "Fix Issue" .-> Plan
    CI_Check -- "Yes" --> Ship
    Ship -. "Resolves" .-> Issue
```

1. **Planning & Execution** (`/plan-sdlc`, `/execute-plan-sdlc`)
   - Scopes requirements, proposes architectural decisions, and breaks down the work into manageable tasks.
   - Executes the implementation plan systematically while adhering to guardrails.
2. **Committing** (`/commit-sdlc`)
   - Automatically generates smart, conventional commit messages by analyzing your staged diff and recent project history.
3. **Code Review** (`/review-sdlc`)
   - Performs a comprehensive, automated code review of your changes against predefined dimensions (e.g., security, architecture, performance) before you open a Pull Request.
4. **Pull Requests** (`/pr-sdlc`)
   - Generates detailed, well-structured PR descriptions based on the diff and commit history.
5. **Continuous Integration** (`/verify-pipeline-sdlc`)
   - Interfaces with GitHub Actions to monitor, verify, and diagnose CI/CD pipeline runs for your PRs.
6. **Hardening & Recovery** (`/error-report-sdlc`, `/harden-sdlc`)
   - If a pipeline fails or an error occurs, these skills analyze the failure to suggest stronger guardrails, preventing the same class of failure in the future.
7. **Shipping & Release** (`/version-sdlc`, `/ship-sdlc`)
   - Automates semantic versioning, changelog generation, and finalizing the release of the project.
