# PR Labels Sub-Flow

Configure how `/pr-sdlc` chooses labels for a project (issue #197). Writes the
`pr.labels` block in `.sdlc/config.json`. Three modes are supported:

- `off` (default) — no automatic labels; only forced labels via `--label` apply
- `rules` — deterministic evaluation of user-defined `{ label, when }` rules
- `llm` — legacy fuzzy matching by the model (opt-in only)

This sub-flow is invoked by `setup-sdlc` via the `delegatedTo: 'setup-pr-labels'`
section descriptor (`pr-labels` row in `setup-sections.js`).

---

## Scan Input

This sub-flow loads everything it needs at runtime — no scan input from the
parent is required. It calls `gh label list` itself and reads the existing
`pr.labels` block (if any) from `.sdlc/config.json`.

---

## Arguments

None.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Prerequisite: Repo labels

Run:

```bash
gh label list --json name,description --limit 100
```

- **Exit 0:** parse the JSON array into `repoLabels = [{ name, description }, ...]`.
- **Auth or remote failure (any non-zero exit):** print:

  > `gh label list` failed. The pr-labels sub-flow needs an authenticated `gh`
  > and a GitHub remote. Run `gh auth login` (or `gh auth status` to check) and
  > re-run `setup-sdlc --only pr-labels`. No changes were written.

  Exit cleanly without writing anything to `.sdlc/config.json`.

If `repoLabels` is empty (repo has no custom labels yet), warn the user and
continue — `off` is still a valid choice; `rules` will require creating labels
in GitHub first; `llm` will produce no suggestions.

### Step 2 — Idempotency check

Read `.sdlc/config.json` via `readSection(projectRoot, 'pr')`. If
`pr.labels` already exists, present the current state and ask:

```
Current pr.labels:
  mode:  <off|rules|llm>
  rules: N entries (when applicable)
```

Use AskUserQuestion:

> `pr.labels` is already configured. What do you want to do?

Options (only show options that make sense for the current mode):

- **keep** — exit without changes
- **replace** — wipe the current block and start fresh (Step 3)
- **append** — only when current `mode = 'rules'`: add rules to the existing
  list (skip Step 3 mode prompt; jump to the rules loop in Step 4 with the
  existing rules pre-loaded)

If `pr.labels` is absent, skip this step and go to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Mode selection

Use AskUserQuestion:

> How should `/pr-sdlc` choose labels?

Options:

- **off** — never auto-add labels (default; `--label` CLI overrides still work)
- **rules** — apply deterministic rules I define below
- **llm** — let the model decide using fuzzy matching against repo labels
- **cancel** — abort without writing

Branch on the choice:

- `off` → Step 5 with `{ mode: 'off' }` (no rules)
- `llm` → Step 5 with `{ mode: 'llm' }` (no rules)
- `rules` → Step 4
- `cancel` → exit cleanly, no write

### Step 4 — Rules loop (mode = `rules` only)

Maintain an in-memory `rules: []` array. If `append` was selected in Step 2,
seed it with the existing `pr.labels.rules`.

Iterate:

1. **Add rule?** Use AskUserQuestion:

   > Add a label rule? (current count: <N>)

   Options:
   - **add** — define another rule (continue to step 4.2)
   - **review** — show the current rule list and stay in the loop
   - **done** — write `{ mode: 'rules', rules: [...] }` and exit (Step 5)
   - **cancel** — abort without writing

   On `review`: print the current `rules` array in human-readable form
   (`label → when.<signal>: [values]`) then re-ask.

2. **Pick the target label.** Use AskUserQuestion with options drawn from
   `repoLabels` (alphabetized). When `repoLabels.length > 10`, paginate the
   options and add a **search** option that takes a substring filter and
   re-presents the list. Reject any free-text label that is not in
   `repoLabels[].name` — the user must pick from the list.

3. **Pick the signal type.** Use AskUserQuestion:

   > Which signal triggers this rule?

   Options:
   - **branchPrefix** — match if the current branch starts with one of these prefixes (e.g. `fix/`, `feat/`)
   - **commitType** — match if any commit subject begins with `<type>:` or `<type>(scope):`
   - **pathGlob** — match if every changed file matches one of these globs (e.g. `**/*.md`)
   - **jiraType** — match if `jiraTicket.type` is in the list (e.g. `Bug`, `Story`)
   - **diffSizeUnder** — match if total lines changed is below this threshold

4. **Enter the value(s).** Use AskUserQuestion (free text):

   - For `branchPrefix`, `commitType`, `pathGlob`, `jiraType`:
     prompt for a comma-separated list. Trim whitespace, drop empties, dedupe.
     Reject empty input — at least one value is required.
   - For `diffSizeUnder`: prompt for a single positive integer. Reject
     non-integer or zero/negative input and re-ask.

5. **Append and confirm.** Build the rule object:

   ```js
   { label: <chosen>, when: { <signalKey>: <values> } }
   ```

   Append to `rules`, then loop back to step 4.1.

### Step 5 — Write

Build the final block:

- `off` → `{ mode: 'off' }`
- `llm` → `{ mode: 'llm' }`
- `rules` → `{ mode: 'rules', rules: [...] }`

Locate the config helper:

```bash
for d in "antigravity" "plugins/sdlc" "plugins/sdlc-utilities" "$HOME/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc" "$HOME/.gemini/plugins/sdlc"; do [ -z "$SDLC_ROOT" ] && [ -f "$d/plugin.json" ] && SDLC_ROOT="$d"; done
source "${SDLC_ROOT:?ERROR: SDLC plugin root not found.}/scripts/run.sh" "skills/setup-sdlc/scripts/setup-pr-labels_load_config.sh"
```

Then merge the labels block into the existing `pr` section without clobbering
`titlePattern`, `allowedTypes`, or any other sibling key:

```bash
node -e "
const { readSection, writeSection } = require('$SCRIPT');
const root = process.cwd();
const current = readSection(root, 'pr') || {};
const next = { ...current, labels: <BLOCK_AS_JSON> };
writeSection(root, 'pr', next);
console.log('Wrote pr.labels to .sdlc/config.json');
"
```

Substitute `<BLOCK_AS_JSON>` with the JSON-stringified labels block.

### Step 6 — Confirm

Print a one-line summary:

```
Wrote pr.labels: mode=<mode>[, rules=<N>] to .sdlc/config.json
This block is consumed by /pr-sdlc Step 2b (Infer Labels).
```

---

## Quality Gates

Before marking complete, verify:

- The mode chosen is exactly one of `off`, `rules`, or `llm`
- When `mode = 'rules'`, every rule has exactly one signal key in `when` and at
  least one value
- Every rule's `label` exists in the scanned `repoLabels`
- The written JSON validates against `schemas/sdlc-config.schema.json`
- No partial writes occurred when the user cancelled or `gh` failed

## Error Recovery

> **Flow**: detect → diagnose → auto-recover (retry once if transient) → invoke `error-report-sdlc` for persistent actionable failures.

| Error | Recovery | Invoke error-report-sdlc? |
|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| `gh label list` fails (auth/remote) | Print actionable hint, exit cleanly with no write | No — actionable by user |
| `repoLabels` is empty | Warn, allow `off`/`llm`, gate `rules` behind "create labels first" message | No |
| `lib/config.js` not found | Show error, stop without writing | Yes |
| User picks `cancel` at any step | Exit cleanly, do not write partial state | No |
| `writeSection` throws | Show stderr, do not retry — preserve any prior state | Yes |

When invoking `error-report-sdlc`, provide:
- **Skill**: setup-sdlc (pr-labels sub-flow)
- **Step**: Step 5 — Write
- **Operation**: `lib/config.js#writeSection('pr', ...)`
- **Error**: full stderr/stack
- **Suggested investigation**: file permissions on `.sdlc/config.json`; plugin install integrity

## Gotchas

1. **Never clobber sibling `pr.*` keys.**
   *Symptom:* `pr.titlePattern` (or any other `pr.*` key) is wiped after the
   sub-flow runs.
   *Root cause:* Calling `writeSection(root, 'pr', { labels: ... })` replaces
   the entire `pr` section.
   *Mitigation:* Always read the current `pr` section, spread it, and only
   override the `labels` key (Step 5 does this explicitly).

2. **Empty `repoLabels` looks like a `gh` failure but isn't.**
   *Symptom:* User sees no labels to pick from in `rules` mode and assumes
   their `gh auth` is broken.
   *Root cause:* Brand-new repos may have zero custom labels (only the GitHub
   defaults that some orgs strip).
   *Mitigation:* Distinguish "exit non-zero" (auth/remote) from "node -e 'process.exit(0)' with
   `[]`" (no labels). The latter is a content state, not an error.

3. **`pathGlob` semantics are stricter than expected.**
   *Symptom:* User adds rule `documentation` when `pathGlob: ["**/*.md"]` and
   later notices the label doesn't get applied to a PR that touched `*.md` and
   one `package.json` file.
   *Root cause:* The evaluator uses **all-changed-files** semantics — every
   changed file must match. This is the same posture as the legacy `*.md`
   inference rule.
   *Mitigation:* Note in the value-entry prompt that `pathGlob` means "every
   changed file matches one of these globs". For "any matches" semantics,
   point users at `commitType` instead.

4. **Append mode and replace mode look similar.**
   *Symptom:* User picks `replace` thinking they will edit the existing rules,
   but the new rule list overwrites everything.
   *Root cause:* Both options exit through the same Step 4 loop; only
   `append` seeds the in-memory list with existing rules.
   *Mitigation:* In Step 2, show the current rule count before asking, and on
   `replace` print "Existing rules will be discarded" before entering Step 3.

5. **`gh label list --limit 100` may truncate.**
   *Symptom:* Repo has more than 100 labels; some labels never appear in the
   pick list.
   *Root cause:* The `--limit 100` cap is hard-coded.
   *Mitigation:* Document the cap in the prompt; if pagination is hit, suggest
   the user create labels with shorter names or use `llm` mode.

## DO NOT

- Do NOT write `.sdlc/config.json` on any prompt where the user picks `cancel`.
- Do NOT replace the entire `pr` section — only set/replace the `labels` key.
- Do NOT accept a free-text label that isn't in `repoLabels` — the rule will be
  stripped by `pr.js` validation later, leaving the user with a silent dead rule.
- Do NOT proceed to the rules loop if `gh label list` failed — `rules` mode
  without a known label set produces unverifiable rules.
- Do NOT prompt for `mode` again when the user picked `append` in Step 2 —
  append implies `rules` mode.
