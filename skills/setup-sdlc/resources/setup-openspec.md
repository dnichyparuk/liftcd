# OpenSpec Enrichment Sub-Flow

Enriches `openspec/config.yaml` with a managed block pointing contributors to
`/plan-sdlc`, `/execute-plan-sdlc`, and `/ship-sdlc`. Idempotent: re-running
at the current plugin version is a no-op.

> **Permission context:** This sub-flow inherits the parent skill's permission mode.
> Do NOT call ExitPlanMode, change permission settings, or exit any mode during this sub-flow.

## Arguments

- `--remove` — remove the managed block instead of adding/updating it

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Run openspec-enrich.js

Locate and run the enrichment script:

```bash
for d in "antigravity" "plugins/sdlc" "plugins/sdlc-utilities" "$HOME/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc" "$HOME/.gemini/plugins/sdlc"; do [ -z "$SDLC_ROOT" ] && [ -f "$d/plugin.json" ] && SDLC_ROOT="$d"; done
source "${SDLC_ROOT:?ERROR: SDLC plugin root not found.}/scripts/run.sh" "skills/setup-sdlc/scripts/setup-openspec_enrich.sh"
```

Replace `{REMOVE_FLAG}` with `--remove` if the parent passed `--remove-openspec`, otherwise omit it.

### Step 2 — Parse and report

Parse the JSON output from `$PREPARE_OUTPUT_FILE`. Report the result:

- `action: "append"` — "Managed block added to openspec/config.yaml."
- `action: "update"` — "Managed block updated to v{version} in openspec/config.yaml."
- `action: "unchanged"` — "openspec/config.yaml already at current version — no changes needed."
- `action: "removed"` — "Managed block removed from openspec/config.yaml."
- `action: "missing"` — "openspec/config.yaml not found. Initialize OpenSpec first (`openspec init`)."
- `action: "skipped-existing-context"` — "openspec/config.yaml already declares a top-level `context:` key. The managed block was not appended to avoid creating a duplicate YAML key. Manually fold sdlc-utilities guidance into your existing `context:` value, then re-run."

If a `warning` field is present, display it.

Return to the parent skill (Step 5 summary).
