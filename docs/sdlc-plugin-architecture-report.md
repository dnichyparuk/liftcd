# SDLC Plugin Architecture & Agents Relation Report

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the architecture, agent structure, inter-component relations, and model routing strategy within the Antigravity Agentic SDLC Plugin.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

The SDLC plugin is structured as a hierarchical multi-agent system designed to isolate heavy context processing from the main user-facing chat session. It splits responsibilities into four distinct layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User([User Interaction]) --> Skills[Layer 1: User-Facing Skills<br>CLI Gates, State & Verification]
    Skills --> Orchestrators[Layer 2: Orchestrator Agents<br>Isolated Reasoning, No Side-Effects]
    Orchestrators --> SubAgents[Layer 3: Sub-Agents / Workers<br>Parallel Code & Web Research]
    Skills -.-> Scripts[Layer 4: CLI Scripts & Libs<br>Context Preparation & Local State]
```

### Layer 1: User-Facing Skills (Main Context)
User-invocable commands (e.g., `/ship-sdlc`, `/plan-sdlc`, `/commit-sdlc`) that run directly in the user's primary conversation.
* **Responsibilities:** Interactive menus, safety check gates, compiling/running tests, committing staged files, pushing to Git, and executing CLI tools (such as `gh`).
* **Isolation Strategy:** Skills delegating heavy analysis task-by-task to **Layer 2** via the `Agent` tool. This keeps the main chat transcript thin, avoiding context limit issues on long sessions.

### Layer 2: Orchestrator Agents (Isolated Context)
Orchestrators (e.g., `commit-orchestrator`, `review-orchestrator`) defined via Markdown files in `agents/`.
* **Responsibilities:** Pure reasoning over serialized manifests. They read structured context, perform self-critique loops, and return clean JSON or plain-text strings.
* **Hard Constraints:** Orchestrator agents cannot call Git, write files (with minor exceptions for output briefs), invoke external CLIs, or inherit the parent conversation transcript.

### Layer 3: Sub-Agents & Workers
Specialized tasks dispatched in parallel by orchestrator agents or orchestrator skills.
* **Examples:** Plan critique lanes (e.g., `lane-guardrail-compliance`), planning lens reviewers, and parallel code-review dimension checkers.
* **Responsibilities:** Scanning files, searching the web, or validating requirements concurrently, reporting structured findings back to their parent orchestrator.

### Layer 4: CLI Scripts & Libraries
Programmatic helper scripts (written in Node.js/Bash) invoked by the main skills to serialize git history, calculate token budgets, and track state.
* **Key Modules:** [state.js](file:///home/dzmitry/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc/scripts/lib/state.js) for state management and [dispatch-budget.js](file:///home/dzmitry/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc/scripts/lib/dispatch-budget.js) for context constraints.

## 3. Model Routing & Quality Preset System

Rather than using a single model for all tasks, the plugin utilizes **quality-tier model routing** to optimize speed, reasoning performance, and cost.

### A. Quality Presets
The `--quality` flag (provided in `ship-sdlc` or `execute-plan-sdlc`) configures the routing engine as follows:

1. **`minimal` (Speed):** Forces `gemini-3.5-flash` for all tasks (assigning `-medium` for standard and `-high` for complex), bypassing pro models and compliance checks. Ideal for simple refactors or fast iterations.
2. **`balanced` (Default):** Dynamically assigns tasks. Trivial/standard tasks are routed to `gemini-3.5-flash-medium`, while architectural design or complex failures escalate to `gemini-3.1-pro-low`.
3. **`full` (Quality):** Forces `gemini-3.1-pro` for all non-trivial tasks (`-low` for standard, `-high` for complex), enabling spec compliance audits and deeper critique steps.

### B. Reasoning Budget Suffixing
For agent dispatches, computational reasoning limits are assigned statically via hardcoded suffixes appended to the target model identifier:
* **`-low`:** Minimizes latency and costs by skipping extended reasoning loops (e.g., `gemini-3.5-flash-low`). Permanently mapped to orchestrators (like `wave-runner` and `error-report-orchestrator`), simple extractors, and fast mechanical validators.
* **`-medium`:** Balanced reasoning depth and cost optimization (e.g., `gemini-3.5-flash-medium`). Mapped to workers executing standard, multi-file code generation.
* **`-high`:** Allocates maximum dynamic reasoning and computation steps (e.g., `gemini-3.1-pro-high`). Reserved strictly for workers executing ambiguous, high-stakes architectural tasks and complex coding.

*Note: Per-task workers dynamically inherit reasoning suffixes through the Model Presets, while orchestrators are permanently locked to `-low` budgets since they only perform mechanical string parsing and routing.*

## 4. State Persistence, Telemetry, and Resume Patterns

The SDLC plugin operates a **local-only** session tracking system. No telemetry data leaves the developer's computer.

### A. State Files
State files are written atomically (`temp write` + `rename` pattern) in the main worktree directory under `.sdlc/execution/`.
* **Path Pattern:** `<main-worktree>/.sdlc/execution/<prefix>-<branchSlug>-<timestamp>.json`
* **JSON Structure:** Stores active branch names, step statuses, resolved CLI flags, and metadata such as the `committedSha` of completed execution waves.

### B. Compact Recovery
Since conversation history is regularly compacted by the IDE sandbox to save tokens, session hooks are used to preserve pipeline state:
* **`stop-state-save.js` (Stop Hook):** Fires after each response, writing current progress to `.sdlc/execution/.compact-recovery-<branch Slug>.json`.
* **`session-start.js` (PreInvocation Hook):** Fires at startup. If a recovery file is found, it automatically injects active pipeline details back into the system-reminder, prompting the LLM that a pipeline is active.
* **TTL (Time to Live):** Compact recovery files are valid for 1 hour. Stale files (>24 hours) are cleaned up by session start hooks.

### C. Resume Types
* **Ship Resume:** Invoked via `/ship-sdlc --resume`. Re-loads ship state from disk and resumes at the first pending step.
* **Execute Resume:** Invoked via `/execute-plan-sdlc --resume`. Re-runs the Wave-runner at the first incomplete wave, checking previously `committedSha` values to prevent duplicate execution of committed waves.
* **Post-Compact Resume (Implicit):** If `session-start.js` detects a session compaction, `execute-plan-sdlc` bypasses user confirmation prompts and resumes execution silently (in `--auto` mode) or with a single confirmation prompt (in interactive mode).

## 5. Token Budgets & Fan-Out Sizing

Parallel worker dispatches (such as fanning out 5 plan lanes or multiple review dimensions) are gated by a context-budget calculator in [dispatch-budget.js](file:///home/dzmitry/.gemini/config/plugins/sdlc/scripts/lib/dispatch-budget.js).

1. **Input Budget Allocation:** The engine reserves **75%** of the model's total context window for inputs (e.g., templates, guardrails, diffs, logs), leaving **25%** for reasoning output space.
   * `gemini-3.5-flash` and `gemini-3.1-pro` variants context ceiling: 1M tokens (~3MB) (all models uniformly share the same window)
2. **Task Pack Algorithm:** Candidate tasks are sorted by their fact-sheet sizes in ascending order. The budget calculator packs tasks until the byte budget is consumed or the static concurrency limits are reached.
3. **Static Concurrency Caps:** To prevent API rate-limit errors and excessive parallel overhead, a progressive cap system is enforced:

| Remaining Tasks | Maximum Concurrent Dispatches |
|---|---|
| 1–3 | No limit (runs all) |
| 4–8 | Max 4 parallel agents |
| 9–15 | Max 5 parallel agents |
| 16+ | Max 6 parallel agents |
